The second week lectures, especially on DPC computations and iterations were very interesting and stimulating. Even though the basic principles behind the computations. are quite clear, when they are being done by the Instructor, the real test, I feel, will come in only when numerical problems are to be tackled independently. Hence, I would suggest that numerical problems may be set for the students, to ensure a better grasp. This can be independent of the homework assignment or the exam and may be in the form of a link,where such problems will be available for those who may be interested. Thank you.

I'm enjoying the lectures! I'm in the middle of the Cellular module and I've only had a few (5 or 6) multiple questions appear. And when a multiple question appears, it sometimes pops-up in the middle of a lecture (indeed, middle of a sentence in some instances) not at the end of lecture. Is this a glitch or is it planned this way? It's fine with me, keeps me on my attention from attenuating;)<br />But I am wondering if I'm missing out on more questions because of a glitch.

Since there is no certificate of accomplishment will be issued in this course, I therefore suggest that we can increase number of attempts (say 30 attempts) for the quiz so that we can clarify our understanding of theories by attempting more times to correct our answers.<br />

Chris, In question #2 the channel gain between Transmitter C and Receiver C was initially given as 0.1 i.e. 1/10 (NOT 1.0). I attempted the question two three times and I distinctly remember&nbsp;the channel gain between Transmitter C and Receiver C was initially given as 0.1 i.e. 1/10 (NOT 1.0).<br />So I got SIRa=2.5, SIRb=1.5 and SIRc=0.2 &nbsp;and on second iteration I got SIRa=2.143, SIRb=1.64, SIRc=0.2419

Homework is great. Its multiple choice quiz after every lecture. If you follow the lecture then its very easy to answer and the evaluation is instantaneous so you get great feedback right away. If you did not get the answer right you could right away replay the video and learn what you may have missed or overlooked! See you next week.

Yes and this gives us time to adapt our rhythm to the requirements and thus to enjoy the first lectures on lazy moments (although yes, I take notes)... while suffering on other courses that started some weeks earlier: no need to wonder first how HW will fit in the schedule. I love that! Besides, lectures are informative, instructive, and great: I'll take the one with calculus, but this version helps me learn effectively and go my own path in the summer, getting accustomed with the topics and concepts in a soft manner. Congratulations to Christopher and team!

I am enrolled in both network courses as much as I would like to do the homework in the Networking with the Calculus I enrolled in the other course for the videos. I have coding for work up to my eyeballs. I was hoping to return to school this quarter but I will have to wait until I have the current coding project completed. Even if I were to drop my courser courser courses which I can't, they are work related. If I were to go back to my school right now, I wound lose my job or mess up school so I will have to wait 5 and 1/2 weeks.

LOL welcome to Coursera' world! These are not glitches. They are sometimes carefully inserted, sometimes not (I guess it requires additional time-consuming work, - so I don't mind, - surely depends on the size of the team, i.e. how many TAs most often). However, I recently noticed in some other Coursera courses extra stops that don't bring anything but an invitation to click further. Still having (quite clueless) hypotheses on this emerging phenomenon.<br />Nevertheless, yes, it is meant to help memorizing - is initially designed with this purpose. And it serves for many of us to check oursides that we did not fell asleep as it happens at the end of a long working day. Also, as far as I know (please consider my following assertion cautiously), they are never integrated as partial marks into the final grade as some people with intermittent connection prefer to download the lectures and watch them offline.

Good luck with your current project, anon. We are many in this case and have diverse strategies, - the first one being: struggling hard, despairing as little as possible, trusting the future to give us this MOOC opportunity for ever from now. I, for one, sometimes go on at my own pace with the hope of maybe retaking the course on the next offering with more involvment (also, I download then the lectures and even some exercises and the accompanying notices before any access gets denied after the end of the course, as it happens sometimes).<br />Take care!&nbsp;

I went through the whole process a number of times, each time coming up with the wrong answer (after checking, rechecking etc etc) and I'd like to state what I did wrong even if it helps one other person!

I believe it is a clear typo that the value should have been shown as 1.0 for C's signal instead of 0.1 as shown. Mind you I didn't get "the right answer" even with this assumption, but that could be because it is the early hours of the morning here and I attempted to work out all the calculations with pen and paper instead of using a calculator! I can't see any way that the 0.1 value is intentional though, so I suspect the safest bet is to use the 1.0 value until the typo is fixed.<br />
****

Craig<br /><br />I'm in the same boat - incorrect answer for #2 using the assumption that the value should have been 1.0 instead of 0.1 - all other answers were correct<br /><br />As an afterthought, that question 3 was marked as correct validates that the correct value was intended to be 1.0 in that table....<br />
****

Should be 1.0. Typo. Sorry about that!<br /><br />Also, I tried to make these problems a little challenging, just to stimulate more discussion. Don't worry if there were some issues with it. The exams will be a good combination of both conceptual problems (like the video lectures) and computations (like the homework, but probably easier).
****
599445
3
Ah, actually that's because the computation is done slightly differently in that course. Try "transposing" the table -- replace the columns by the rows. In the other course, the rows are the receivers and the columns are the transmitters, which makes it easier for matrices but less straightforward for hand calculations.
****

I must have muddled something up....<br />The spreadsheet did indeed come up with my values for A &amp; C but decided that 1.33 was better than my hand calc'ed number in my incorrect answer....<br />

Hi Wolfgang -- Technically, it goes like this (as we did in the lecture):<br /><br />Initial Transmit Powers<br />Initial SIRs<br />Iteration 1 Transmit Powers<br />Iteration 1 SIRs<br /><b>Iteration 2 Transmit Powers</b><br />Iteration 2 SIRs<br /><br />So that's the one I'm looking for.<br /><br />But let me say, great job that you can do the calculations. I must say it's unfortunate to have to do all this as multiple choice, because if you understand the calculation anyway that's at least 90% right. So don't treat this as an absolute score, judge it more by your understanding.

You're right. When it came time to actually do the problems &nbsp;I had to go back and review the lecture, carefully think about the algorithm and procedure involved, and still I made several computational errors. Doing the homework is excellent learning reinforcement.

Wolfgang, I did the same thing, and I have to say I think we were correct (sorry Chris). The first execution uses the starting powers to determine the new ones. The new powers aren't know until AFTER then first iteration. Then the second execution uses those powers to determine the ones that Chris says he was looking for. So, the "correct answer" was not known until &nbsp;AFTER the second time the code executed (i.e. the second iteration), not DURING the execution.&nbsp;<br /><br />That said, it's no big deal. Just a matter of semantics I guess. It's kind of unfortunate, though, that the answer you and I came up with was one of the choices.&nbsp;
****
599445
3
Again, not a big deal. But in the question I asked for the transmit powers DURING the second iteration. They get updated right at the beginning of the second iteration, and stay like that until the third iteration starts. Remember we start with iteration 0, then iteration 1, then iteration 2. So i wanted DPC to be applied twice.
****
599445

Ah, you used the table the other way. Many people prefer that actually. And it makes it more convenient when using matrices to solve the problem. But for hand calculations, I think most people like it better to have the rows "from" and the columns "to", so that's why I used this convention.

I am the same as John, I did not read it that way, and hence the calculations were off.<br /><br />I read A to A as 1.0 B to A as 0.2 C to A as 0.1<br />NOT <br />A to A as 1.0 B to A as 0.2 C to A as 0,2 (which would have been correct)<br /><br /><img title="Image: https://coursera-forum-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/f2/24456d8a934c04506cd1552560d423/Capture.JPG" alt="image" style="width:380px;height:205px;" src="https://coursera-forum-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/f2/24456d8a934c04506cd1552560d423/Capture.JPG" /><br /><br />this had a knock on effect for the next question as well.<br />3/5<br /><br />edit: on a side note, is the submission date correct mine looks like<br /><img title="Image: https://coursera-forum-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/11/3a7e0d447a3505d5968ac9670f9cc4/Capture.JPG" alt="image" style="width:490px;height:136px;" src="https://coursera-forum-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/11/3a7e0d447a3505d5968ac9670f9cc4/Capture.JPG" /><br /> which is 2ish+ months from now (give or take)?

Hi Anonymous -- yes, I see what you did. In the lecture I explained it the other way, though, and it actually says above there that the transmitters are down the rows and receivers across the columns. Maybe what you can do in the future is just "transpose" the table, and then work through it your way.<br /><br />I set the due date that far ahead because there's no "deadline", since there's no certificates.

I sort of get what is going on, but why do we not consider the other AP (for example G when computing throughput for A) as another device that should "not transmit"?<br />Thus 0.4*(0,6)**3&nbsp; [instead of 2]<br />

The explanation feedback for the question does a good job of explaining the reason. Read the first line of the explanation. The first line should actually read D-G instead of D-F, but the rationale has been stated. If there is something specific that you are finding confusing, kindly state the problem. ABC are on one channel, DEFG are on a different one.<br />

Great discussion. Correct that you should assume the two groups do not interfere with one another.<br /><br />With the homework, don't treat it as a quiz.

I got that question wrong too! The diagram threw me off. In the lecture slides, the probability of other stations not transmitting was (1-ProbTrans)^the number of other stations and&nbsp;in that diagram the number of stations accounted&nbsp;were only those within the circle. So that's what I did here. I didn't take into account the non-overlapping. Does that mean the in the slides diagram, the channels were overlapping?
****

I see.&nbsp;I guess it's irrelevant then that the diagram showed the transmission ranges overlapping because the channels were actually non-overlapping. Thank you!

I don't know where 30 Sept. is stated.

There are no certificates, so final grades or pass/fail criteria don't really apply. <br /><br />
****

I can accept that AP C and AP G may be on different channels, but the problem did not make that point clear.&nbsp; If that is the case (different channels), then a transmitter that is paired to one channel shouldn't interfere with transmissions occurring on a different channel.&nbsp; Maybe I am over-thinking the permutations.<br />
****
599303

Below the diagram, it is stated in the problem "Suppose the two access points are each using non-overlapping channels". It is also stated, "As shown, A and B are associating with C, while D, E, and F are associating with G." So A,B,C are using one channel and the rest are on another non-overlapping channel. I don't quite understand your argument about pairs. A,B,C are all on the same single shared channel. Now, if A wants to transmit something (successfully without collision), it would require that both B and C are silent at that time and if we think of probability as a roll of the dice, then at that time A rolls a go ahead to transmit. Since D,E,F,G are on a non-overlapping different channel, so A,B,C is independent of the other network.&nbsp; <br />
****
599445

Hi Priyanka -- Yes, they were all using the same channel there. I just wanted to point out in the homework that we can have two channels that are not overlapping (as I pointed out in the lecture), and in that case they won't interfere. Just to bring FDMA into the mix.

At about 5:13 in the CSMA backoff lecture Chris clearly states that after the FIRST collision (i.e. lack of ACK), the transmitter uses the CURRENT window size, and increases the window size after each subsequent collision. The way the question is worded, I assumed that it was talking about that first collision, but apparently it wasn't.<br /><br />It seems to me that a better (and less ambiguous) question would have been "What does it do after the second collision?" or something like.
****

Thank you for pointing this out. That's a good point. I'll reword the question.

****
2434675

Glad to be of service!&nbsp;<br /><br />Thinking about this, I came up a question. I'm assuming that the window size must get reset at some point, otherwise all the transmitters would end up waiting forever. When does that happen? Do the transmitters keep a a running total of collisions, or reset after each ACK, or what?&nbsp;
****
599445
1
Actually, it gets reset back to its original size once you get the frame through. The purpose of increasing the contention window size is to respond to congestion "frame-by-frame", so once you move to the next one you start over.<br /><br />I didn't want to go into too much detail in the lecture, but maybe I should have clarified!

HI,<br /><br />I went back to review the homework and the explanations, but was unable to find my earlier completed homework submittal under the homework tab. &nbsp;Instead, I was presented with a fresh homework assignment. Is submitted homework logged in the system and how can I retrieve my earlier submittal for further review?<br /><br />Thanks.

Hi Richard,<br /><br />Not entirely sure how to receive that. Maybe other students know? If not, I'm sure the answer is buried on Coursera's site somewhere.<br /><br />Let me know if you figure it out.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Chris

In other coursera courses I have taken, the quizzes etc. are structured so that their is an option like "Show Previous Attempts" and "Review". It makes it easy to revisit any and all of your previous attempts. So, coursera certainly has the functionality. Maybe, the functionality is unique to quizzes and not homeworks or maybe there is some way to configure the homeworks a bit differently. So, maybe the coursera technical staff can help the instructors in formatting the homework/quiz to enable the functionality which is present in other courses. <br /><br />As for the first homework of this course, I also thought that a review button would be useful. I did end up reviewing an attempt by going to 'history' in firefox and selecting some entry like homework feedback or maybe some other wording. So, if you haven't cleared history since doing the homework, you should be able to browse to the relevant date and entry to see the webpage of your attempt along with the explanations. I needed to review the homework as I was commenting on some questions in the forum and needed to revisit the wording of the questions.<br />

I was unable to find a standard Coursera means to retrieve submitted homework so I came up with this work-around:&nbsp;I ended up redoing the homework and resubmitting it. When the system provided the response to my new submittal, including your explanations, I saved the window as a "Webpage, Complete" to my hard drive. From there I can reference the full window of the results whenever I wish. So, on the next assignments I'll save the window before I close it, avoiding the redo step.<br /><br /><br />

I am not taking any other course right now, but will be starting the Intro to Mathematical Philosophy course in about a week's time. However, I have taken other coursera courses, both recently and a fair time before, in which this has been pretty much a default/standard function (for I think every course). <br /><br />Here is a screenshot from a recently finished course, <a target="" href="http://oi42.tinypic.com/acr774.jpg">http://oi42.tinypic.com/acr774.jpg</a><br />There is a "show previous attempts" button and then clicking the link "review" shows the graded previous attempts. Same thing for midterms and finals. I think Coursera technical staff can advise as to how to enable this functionality.<br />

Hi Chris,<br />I had taken other Coursea courses. They showed your score for every attempt in homework/assignment/exam as well as the history&nbsp; of your attempt. You can review the details of particular attempt in the history. Since this course will not issue certificate of accomplishment, there might be no need for the system to monitor the score of the students. For this course, I only print my quizz/exam results after the attempt as the system does not offer such history record.<br /><br />

If the feature is unavailable as per Li's reason, then no big deal. No pressing need to spend time adding the feature. Manley's save method works well enough.

Hi Chris,<br /><br />It has been my experience with taking courses on coursera, that one can retain contents of a lecture much better, when there are a few multiple choice questions(may/may not be mandatory for course completion) between lectures.<br /><br />I know there are a few MCQ's at the end of each lecture when using html5 player, but this is not available for people like me, who wish to download the lectures and view them offline.<br /><br />Could you please put in more multiple choice questions between lectures and also, if possible place them under the ASSESSMENTS section so we can get the maximum out of this course?<br /><br />Thanks.

<p>I
took a wild stab at the answer for this question and got it wrong, as I don't
think I did the calculations for the page rank right.&nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
I started with these sets of equations:<br />
</span><br /></p><p>A = c/2 + b/2<br /></p>

<p>B =&nbsp;d</p>

<p>C = a/2</p>

<p>D = a/2 + c/2</p>

<p>A + b + c + d = 1</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I've had to do
these types of problems; I tried to do the substitution the way it was done in
the video, but I obviously did something wrong.</p>

<p>So in choosing the "reference"
variable, is it best to choose one which is alone in an equation, like A?</p>

<p>I would then try to solve the others to be a
value of A.</p>

<p>so C = A/2</p>

<p>so D = a/2 + c2 = a/2 + a/2 = 2a/2 = a</p>

<p>so b = d = a</p>

<div>

<p>so a + a + a/2 + a = 1</p>

<p>2a/2 + 2a/2 + a/2 + 2a/2 = 1</p>

<p>7a/2 = 1</p>

<p>7a = 2</p>

<p>A = 2/7 = .286</p>

<p>C = a/2 = .286 / 2 = .143</p>

<p>D = b = a = .286</p><p><br /></p><p>I am even close? Where did I go wrong with this? Thanks for any help pointing me in the right direction!</p><p>I don't want the right answer, just some direction as to where I have gone wrong with the math.</p>

1, 2, &amp; 3 will always happen. 4 will not always happen, especially if it's usage-based and you stray above the demand curve.

I do not believe that the price paid always increases with usage, even under usage-based pricing.&nbsp; Consider the Verizon plans discussed in lecture, where, for example, a user who subscribes to the "dotted green" plan may increase from 8 GB to 10 GB per month without incurring extra charge.&nbsp; (One may argue that such a user would have started out with the "dashed red" plan instead, but this is assuming that the user was able to accurately predict usage before signing up.)&nbsp; <br />
****
599303

The verizon example isn't pure usage based pricing. There is a flat rate component and then later usage based pricing. This combination of initial flat + later usage pricing is common for most ISPs. So, on the whole it is a usage based plan but not a pure usage based plan (where you would have no flat rate but usage based pricing from the very beginning). <br /><br />However one way to interpret the choice is that the 'price paid increases' regardless of the plan being pure flat, combination or pure usage. Not from the user point of view, but the ISP perspective. For every GB of data consumed, the service provider has to pay the cost. So, I guess it comes down to how you interpret "price paid". Should you interpret it as the cost to the user or the cost in general? Maybe there is some ambiguity there. In a pure usage based plan, price paid by the user will always increase. In other plans, not necessarily. But the price paid by the ISP will always increase regardless of the pricing plan. At least that is my thought process based on the lectures. <br /><br />Is the original question ambiguous? I don't know. However, only one of the multiple choices can be correct. So, I was able to arrive at the answer once I removed any doubts about the distinction between 'net' and 'overall'. If you look at the original question as well as the choices knowing only one of them can be correct, then the answer is pretty clear. But could it be argued that the wording of the question might be inaccurate? I don't know. Maybe so, maybe not.&nbsp; <br />
****

Yes, the Verizon example is not a purely used-based plan--but then (see the OP) the question doesn't say anything about what kind of plan is to be considered.&nbsp; <br /><br />So perhaps "price paid" does indeed mean "price paid by the ISP."&nbsp; <br />
****

This is an excellent discussion. I am glad to see this.<br /><br />The answer was meant to be 4, and I still believe that is the best choice of all the answers. But to make this question unambiguous, I should have made one of the following changes:<br /><br />Either<br /><br />1. The pricing scheme is pure usage-based (in which case it doesn't matter whether we are referring to a consumer cost or a network cost, they both increase), or<br /><br />2. The pricing scheme is not specified, and the cost is to the provider (in which case that will always increase regardless of the scheme).<br /><br /><br />

If I understand correctly, the baseline predictor of a particular pair of movie and user should be the raw average + bias of user +bias of movie. I got the correct raw average in Q2. And I got Q3 right as well. But using the calculation I used in Q3, I got the answer wrong in Q4. Specifically, the bottom middle baseline predictor of the correct answer is not what I expected. Am I missing something?. I &nbsp;got 4+0.67(II bias)+0.5(D bias) = 5.17. Thank you.&nbsp;

****

You have got the right cosine table. Next step you have to use this similarity table to calculate the neighborhood predictor. For example User A Movie I = baseline predictor + error of neighbor = 3.67 + 1 = 4.67. Since Movie I neighor is Movie III but it has negative correlation of -0,9761870602 and the basline error for Move III for User A is -1, hence the negative of 1 is converted to positive 1 and added to 3.67 to arrive at 4.67. You can then work out for Question 7 based on the neighbor predictor obtained in Question 6.

I&nbsp;hate to admit this but I just chose the answer based on&nbsp;a quick glance&nbsp;without doing a cosine table. By looking at the data, you can tell that these two movies would have a negative correlation by simple comparison.&nbsp; The only other choice of negative correlation is incorrect because it approximates -1, which indicates a strong correlation vs 'virtually no correlation.'

This is more of a conceptual question, although I still can't generate the right answer, I'm not sure how exactly I go about it.<br /><br />I know how to calculate the cosine similarity, and I know that to get the neighborhood predictor we have to do:<br /><br />baseline +/- neighbor's error&nbsp;<br /><br />But I'm not sure how I get from calculating the cosine similarity for one set to get the whole table.<br /><br />I'm looking at the slides from lectures, and the cosines show up on the one for Similarity Values...but how do you decide how to fill out that table?<br /><br />question 5 asked specifically for the correlation between movie I and III...so I could calculate that, but I'm not sure how you fill out the whole chart. Does that make sense?&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
****
599303

Did you successfully answer question 5? Can you calculate the cosine similarity between movies I and III? I assume you have successfully created an error table for the training set (excluding test set) like on page 15 of slides. (might be relevant to remind that there is a mistake on page 15 cosine calculation for movies I and II. <a target="" href="https://class.coursera.org/ni-001/forum/thread?thread_id=155">https://class.coursera.org/ni-001/forum/thread?thread_id=155</a>).<br /><br />If the answer to question 5 is affirmative, then the next step is to tackle question 6. Question 6 asks us to use movies as neighbors, so we will have to do movie similarity.&nbsp; Create a table whose rows and columns are movies. So, the columns of this table will be movies I, II &amp; III. The rows of this table will be movies I, II &amp; III. We are doing movie similarity, so that is why we are constructing such a table. Now, leave the cells I &amp; I, II &amp; II, III &amp; III 'blank' or '-'. Reason being that it makes no sense to compare a movie with itself. Enter the value of cosine similarity from question 5 into the cell [column I &amp; row III]. This table is symmetric. So, enter this value also in [column III &amp; row I]. Now calculate the cosine similarity for movie pair I &amp; II. Enter the result in the two corresponding cells. Finally, calculate the value for the pair II &amp; III. Enter this value in the remaining two cells. You will end up with a table similar to <a target="" href="https://class.coursera.org/ni-001/forum/thread?thread_id=183">https://class.coursera.org/ni-001/forum/thread?thread_id=183</a> . Notice the symmetry of the table. Now, for each column of this table, pick and circle the value that is closest to +1 or -1. This is the best neighbor movie for the column in question. So, you will circle III in column I, III in column II and II in column III. Notice that even though the table is symmetric, the best neighbor for a given movie might be different e.g. Even though the best neighbor of movie I is movie III, it is not necessarily the case that movie III's best neighbor has to be movie I. Instead, movie III's best neighbor is movie II. <br /><br />Now construct a table with movies as columns and users as rows. Fill in the table as posted by Li Pak Kee in the above link. Fill in the cells of this table accordingly. For any chosen cell, if a user has not rated the best neighbor movie, then you would just enter the baseline prediction into the table.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Edit: If cosine value is +ve, baseline prediction + (error) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If cosine value is -ve, baseline prediction - (error)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (error) itself can be +ve or -ve. Use the value (including whatever sign) is present in the error table. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. If cosine value is +ve and the error of best neighbor is -0.4, then ---&gt; baseline prediction + (-0.4) &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If cosine value is -ve and the error of best neighbor is -0.4, then ---&gt; baseline prediction - (-0.4) <br /><br />

Good! Eventually we have the final homework 4 for us to deepen our understanding of course materials of Lecture 7 and 8. There is an improvement in the homework 4 to have the explanation of the answers after we submit our homework 4. We can immediately know how to arrive at the correct answers. We can print the homework 4 with explanations for future revision.<br />

Does this mean that even after the course ends (Sept 2nd), I can still take the final exam (and all the other assignments such as the midterm exam and homework) and able to view a final grade after taking it?<br /><br />I'm currently handling a few other courses on Coursera (that has fixed datelines for each assignment) as well as my school's exam, but my holiday is coming soon and I plan to finish this course during my holiday.

Since there is no certificate of accomplishment will be issued, the taking of exam is voluntary and the scores will not be counted for grade. Hence, you can take the exam any time. Please complete the assignments of other Coursea courses and your school exam first and make use of your holiday to take the final exam.<br />

This course doesn't reward you with a certificate at the end.

I got the last 2 questions in the final exam correct, but was marked wrong. In fact, my answers matched your explanations!

I am not sure. But I suspect that if you want to confirm that your pre-fix choice was correct, you will have to repeat the exam. There is no "show previous attempts" feature for this course. <br />
